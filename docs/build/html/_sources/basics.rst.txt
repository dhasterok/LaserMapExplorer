The Basics
**********

GUI Layout
==========
LaME's user interface is organized into five panels:

* Main Toolbar (Top) : File menu and main toolbar with frequently used functions
* Control Toolbox (Left) : Functions for plotting and analysis
* Plot and Property (Right) Toolbox: Plot selection, plot styling, and calculator for custom fields
* Plot Window (Center): Plot viewer tabs for single plots, multiple plots, and quick view of all fields
* Lower Tabs: Tabs for notes, filters by value, profile plots and user manual.

Where to Start
==============

To begin using *LaME*, load a directory either from the *File Menu* or the *Main Toolbar* (|icon-add-directory|). If you haven't loaded a sample previously, the imported sample will be automatically added to the *Main Toolbar* sample list dropdown.  If you have previously loaded the data, you can load a saved session, a single sample, or a directory of samples. See :doc:`import` for file specifications that LaME can handle.

Once a directory is loaded, use the sample list dropdown to select the desired sample and use *Analyte Selector* ( |icon-atom| ) to choose the fields for analysis, including ratios between elements/analytes (:doc:`top_toolbar`). All work on previous samples will be stored and any images can be recalled from the *Plot Selector* in the *Plot and Property Toolbox*.

Structure of Stored Data
========================

It is useful to know how data are stored within the program, as some operations will clear analyses and associated figures when the underlying data are changed.  *LaME* keeps three versions of the data: *raw data* (original data), *clipped data* (preprocessed data), and *analysis data* (filtered and/or masked).

Raw data
--------

The *raw data* refers to the data read from a file.  It may be uncalibrated (e.g., cps) or calibrated (e.g., ppm).  *LaME* does not currently calibrate LA-ICP-MS data, so any calibrated data should be calibrated in Iolite or XMapTools first.

Cropping ( |icon-crop| ) is applied to the *raw data*, reducing the area analyzed by the code.  The original extent can be restored by clicking the |icon-fit-to-width| button.  The *clipped data* and *analysis data* must be recomputed from *raw data* if the *raw data* is cropped or restored to the original extent.  These operations result in clearing any figures or analyses.  A dialog will appear prompting the user if they wish to proceed before clearing the memory.

Clipped data
------------

The *clipped data* refers to data that are preprocessed.  The preprocessing steps include several potential operations meant to reduce issues with analyses including autoscaling ( |icon-autoscale| ) and rescaling to remove negative values.  While it may alter the values of some data points, it does so by improving stability of some processing methods (e.g., PCA and clustering) that are otherwise skewed by extreme outliers or cannot handle negative values.  These outliers often result from point measurement errors or incorrect calibrations related to differences in mineral ablation properties.  These preprocessing data steps are described in greater detail in the preprocessing subsection (:doc:`left_toolbox`).

Analysis data
-------------

There are three types of :doc:`filtering`  than can be applied to exclude data from analyses and geochemical plots.  These include elemental filters (on = |icon-filter2|, off = |icon-filter| ), polygon masking (on = |icon-polygon-new|, off = |icon-polygon-off| ), and cluster masking (on = |icon-mask-dark|, off = |icon-mask-light| ).  It is possible to use any combination of these and turn them on or off as required.  Each are implemented as a simple pixel by pixel mask.  They can be turned on or off by clicking the icon found in the *Main Toolbar*.  All filters/masks can be turned off by clicking the |icon-map| button.  The filters will automatically be turned on when they are first created.

The *analysis data* are used to produce plots and compute analyses; turning filters and masks on or off results in their recomputation.
