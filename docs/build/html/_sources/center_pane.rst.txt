Plot Window (Center)
********************

Most plots are displayed within the *Plot Window*.  The only exception are profiles, which are displayed in the *Lower Tabs*.  The plots can be viewed individually, a grid, or as a predefined set for quick viewing.

Single View
===========

Displays a single plot.  This view is recommended for the development of most plots, labeling, and drafting of polygons.

Multi View
==========

Allows users to display multiple plots in the same pane.  Users may find this view useful for producing figures with multiple subplots, with minimal post processing necessary for reports or publication.  The multiview may also be used to rapidly compare maps and their values.  Profiles can also be produced on multiple maps at once, simplifying the task of creating coincident multianalyte traverses.

Quick View
==========

Quick view displays all the analytes in a series of subplots to provide a rapid overview of the samples.  Users may customize the order of the samples.
