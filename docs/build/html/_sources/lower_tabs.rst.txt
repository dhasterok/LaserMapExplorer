Lower Tabs
**********

The *Lower Tabs* provide additional functionality for documentation, value filtering, profile visualization, enhancing your analysis workflow, and accessing help resources. 

Notes
=====

The *Notes* tab is a powerful tool for documenting observations and analyses directly within *LaME*.  This integrated note-taking system helps you document your analysis workflow and prepare report-style documentation.  The tab supports reStructuredText (reST) formatting for creating well-structured notes that can be exported as PDF documents.  For detailed information about note-taking features and formatting, see :doc:`notes`.

The tab provides tools for creating, editing, and analyzing profiles, with options for different display styles and error representation. For detailed information about profile analysis, see :doc:`profiles`.
