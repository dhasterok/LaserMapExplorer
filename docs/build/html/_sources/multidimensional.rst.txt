Clustering
==========

Clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning technique that divides a multidimensional dataset into a user specified number of clusters by minimizing the distance between points assigned to clusters and their respective centroids.  The process is iterative, generally improving the location of centroids and the set of points assigned to each with step.  The process concludes when the improvement is below some tolerance or a maximum number of iterations are reached.  As it is unsupervised, clustering does not require the user to train the data.  This provides two advantages: unsupervised methods faster are to train and require less user knowledge and experience to perform.

k-Means
-------

One of the simplest clustering algorithms is k-means, though it is well suited to the task of identifying minerals or zones within minerals.
