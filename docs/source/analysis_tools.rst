Analysis Features
*****************

A systematic approach to data analysis helps ensure quality results and meaningful interpretations.  This section guides you through the progression from initial data exploration to advanced analysis techniques.

Exploratory Analysis
====================

Initial Data Assessment
--------------_--------
When first examining a new dataset:

1. Start with Quick View visualization of all analytes to:
   
   - Assess data quality
   - Identify obvious artifacts
   - Check total count rates and signal stability

2. Use histogram tools to understand elemental distributions:
   
   - Linear scales reveal bulk data characteristics
   - Logarithmic scales highlight trace element patterns

3. Apply noise reduction if needed:
   
   - Edge-preserving filters maintain important boundaries
   - Median filters reduce sporadic noise
   - Bilateral filters preserve edges while smoothing

Key Visualization Tools:

- Scatter plots for examining relationships between elements
- Line plots for profile analysis
- Heatmaps for spatial distribution analysis
- Correlation matrices for element associations

Pattern Recognition
-------------------
1. Correlation Analysis:
   
   - Choose between Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlations based on data characteristics
   - Pearson: Best for linear relationships
   - Spearman: Robust for monotonic relationships
   - Kendall: Handles non-linear relationships well

2. Spatial Patterns:
   
   - Use gradient mapping to emphasize boundaries
   - Apply edge detection for mineral boundary identification
   - Examine compositional zoning patterns

3. Feature Validation:
   
   - Cross-reference features across multiple elements
   - Validate patterns using different analytical approaches
   - Utilize Multi View capabilities for simultaneous visualization

Advanced Analysis
=================
For detailed investigations, LaME offers several sophisticated analysis tools:

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
   
   - Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance
   - Identify dominant compositional trends
   - Visualize relationships between multiple elements

2. Clustering Analysis:
   
   - K-means for distinct groupings
   - Fuzzy c-means for gradational boundaries
   - Optimize cluster numbers using performance metrics

3. Profile Analysis:
   
   - Extract compositional variations along transects
   - Study mineral zoning
   - Analyze reaction boundaries

4. Custom Calculations:
   
   - Create new fields using the calculator
   - Design complex filters
   - Develop specialized analysis metrics
