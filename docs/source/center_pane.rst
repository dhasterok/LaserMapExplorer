Plot Window (Center)
********************

The *Plot Window* serves as the primary area for displaying visual representations of your data.  It offers three distinct viewing modes to suit different analysis needs.

Single View
===========

Single View mode provides focused examination of individual plots.  This mode is ideal for detailed analysis, allowing users to add annotations and labels to enhance plot informativeness.  It's also the primary mode for creating and editing polygons for data selection, offering precise control over the analysis area.

Multi View

Users can populate this view by double-clicking plots in the Plot Selector, enabling direct comparison of different analyses or visualizations.  This mode excels at revealing relationships between different aspects of the data.
