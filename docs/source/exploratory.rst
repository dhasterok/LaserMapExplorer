Exploratory Analysis
********************

Initial examination of data is crucial for understanding sample characteristics and ensuring data quality before proceeding with detailed analysis. *LaME* provides several complementary approaches for this initial exploration phase.

Initial Data Assessment
=======================

When first examining a new dataset, start by visualizing the analyte map of major elements to assess data quality and identify any obvious artifacts. The Quick View tab offers an efficient way to survey all analytes simultaneously. Pay close attention to total count rates and signal stability, as these can indicate data quality issues that may need addressing during processing.

Distribution Analysis
=====================

Understanding elemental distributions forms a critical part of initial data assessment. *LaME*'s histogram tools enable visualization of these distributions through both traditional histograms and kernel density estimation. The choice between linear and logarithmic scales often reveals different aspects of your data - linear scales better show the bulk of the data, while logarithmic scales better reveal trace element patterns.

Correlation Patterns
====================

Element correlations often provide the first insights into mineral chemistry and element associations. LaME offers three correlation methods - Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall - each suited to different types of relationships. Pearson correlation assumes linear relationships and is sensitive to outliers. Spearman and Kendall correlations detect monotonic relationships and are more robust to outliers.

The correlation matrix visualization in LaME uses an intuitive color scheme where positive correlations appear in warm colors and negative correlations in cool colors. This visualization quickly reveals element associations that may warrant further investigation. Strong correlations often indicate either mineral control of certain elements or consistent geochemical behavior.

Spatial Pattern Recognition 
===========================

While statistical measures provide valuable insights, spatial patterns often reveal features not apparent in bulk statistics. *LaME*'s map visualization tools allow exploration of these patterns through various enhancements:

Gradient mapping emphasizes boundaries between different compositional domains. These maps are particularly useful for identifying mineral boundaries and compositional zoning patterns that might be subtle in raw concentration maps.

Feature Validation
==================

Once potential features have been identified, it's important to validate them using multiple approaches. Cross-referencing features across different elements and analytical methods helps confirm their reality and significance. *LaME*'s multi-view capabilities facilitate this validation process by enabling simultaneous visualization of different analytical approaches.
