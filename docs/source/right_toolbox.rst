Right Toolbox
=============

Plot Selector
-------------

The plot selector lists the available plots for display.  The default list includes all isotopes and their normalized versions.  Ratios can be added by selecting them from *Isotope Selector*.  All other plots in the list are generated once they have been created and/or explicitly stored.

Styling Pane
------------

The properties in the styling pane control the look and feel of plots generated from functions in the left toolbox.  In some cases they also control the type of plot that is generated (e.g., scatter plot or heatmap).

Calculator
----------

Use the calculator to create custom fields.  These custom fields can be used to as dimensions on plots or to set marker color values.  Once created, custom fields will be added to associated drop downs.
