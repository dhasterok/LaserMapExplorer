Common Questions & Solutions
============================

This section addresses common questions and issues you may encounter while using LaME.  We encourage users to review these solutions before submitting bug reports.  If you encounter an issue not covered here, please submit a bug report using the bug icon in the main toolbar.

Installation & Setup
--------------------

Q: I'm having trouble installing LaME. What should I check first?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common installation issues can often be resolved by:

* Ensuring Python 3.11 is properly installed and is the active Python version
* Verifying all required dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt`` are installed
* Checking system permissions for installation directories
* Making sure your Anaconda environment is properly activated
* Verifying you have sufficient disk space

   Common installation errors and their resolutions

Q: Why can't LaME find my data files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This usually occurs due to:

* Incorrect file organization - each sample must be in its own subdirectory
* Unsupported file formats - check :doc:`import` for supported formats
* File permission issues - verify read/write permissions
* Network connectivity problems when accessing remote drives

Performance Optimization
========================

Memory Management
-----------------

Q: LaME becomes slow with large datasets. How can I improve performance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize performance:

* Use the crop tool |icon-crop| to focus on regions of interest
* Clear unused plots from the Plot Selector
* Close samples not being actively analyzed using the sample selector dropdown
* Reduce the number of plots in Multi-View mode
* Save your session and restart LaME periodically
* Consider preprocessing data to reduce noise before analysis

Display Issues
--------------

Q: My plots aren't updating after making changes. What should I check?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If plots aren't updating after making changes:

1. Verify filter toggles in the main toolbar aren't masking your data
2. Check the status bar for invalid values
3. Try the refresh button |icon-refresh|
4. Switch plot types temporarily to force a refresh
5. Ensure data is within valid ranges
6. Check that your analysis masks haven't excluded all data points

Data Analysis Troubleshooting
=============================

Filtering & Masks
-----------------

Q: Why are my filters not working as expected?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common filter issues arise from:

* Overlapping filter conditions creating unintended exclusions
* Incorrect AND/OR operations in complex filters
* Filter priority order - filters are applied sequentially
* Data range mismatches between different analytes
* Masks excluding more data than intended

Solutions:

* Review filter conditions carefully in the Filter tab
* Use the filter visualization tools to understand filter effects
* Consider simplifying complex filter combinations
* Verify data ranges match your expectations

Advanced Analysis
-----------------

Q: My clustering results look unexpected. How can I validate them?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To validate clustering results:

* Use the cluster performance plot to evaluate cluster quality
* Try different numbers of clusters and compare results
* Compare results between k-means and fuzzy c-means methods
* Verify data preprocessing steps are appropriate
* Cross-reference with known sample characteristics
* Consider the effects of data scaling on cluster results

Best Practices
==============

Recommended Workflows
---------------------

Here are some recommended workflows for common tasks in LaME:

New Sample Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Start with data quality assessment:
   
   * Use Quick View mode to examine all analytes
   * Check for anomalous values or artifacts
   * Note any missing or problematic data

2. Document initial observations in Notes tab
3. Apply necessary preprocessing:
   
   * Handle negative values appropriately
   * Apply noise reduction if needed
   * Consider data scaling requirements

4. Create basic visualizations:
   
   * Generate analyte maps
   * Examine histograms
   * Create correlation plots

5. Progress to advanced analyses:
   
   * Perform clustering if needed
   * Generate PCA plots
   * Create custom calculations

6. Save work regularly using session save

Data Organization
-----------------

Organize your files effectively:

* Maintain consistent directory structure::

    project_root/
    ├── raw_data/
    │   ├── sample1/
    │   ├── sample2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── processed_data/
    ├── analysis_results/
    └── documentation/

* Use clear naming conventions
* Keep related files together
* Document data sources and processing steps
* Maintain regular backups

Error Reporting
===============

When encountering errors:

1. Document the sequence of steps that led to the problem
2. Use the bug reporting tool |icon-bug| in the main toolbar
3. Include a minimal example dataset if possible
4. Note any error messages exactly as they appear
5. Describe both expected and actual behavior
