Workflow Method Design (WMD)
============================

*LaME* makes it simple to develop processing and analysis workflows for running on multiple samples.  Workflows can be designed directly with the Workflow Design Tool, or your actions on a sample can be recorded to produce a workflow that can then be applied to other samples.  The workflows can be shared between users, making it an easy way to share methods and develop best practices.  This set of design tools can save time when working with many samples and be a convenient way to document processing and analysis methods for publication.
