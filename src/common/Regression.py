# Right now, this is just notes
# Need regression codes that handle linear fitting using total Least-Squares or Deming regression or something similar.
# Fix the intercept (for dating) or the slope(?)
# Need to mask or filter selected points?
# Would be good to include leverage analysis.
# Produce regressions for individual clusters.
# Add annotations for certain types of fits?
# Add equations and stats
